This is the Sunday School Ministry of Tumaini Church in Grogon.
Our Sunday School classes are organized into two groups: one for children aged 0 to 8 
and another for those aged 9 and above. Ideally, the classes would be further
 divided into three groups, with ages 7 and 8 grouped together. However, due to 
 space constraints, we currently combine these age groups.
Our Sunday School activities include:
<div className="child-min">
<span>Bible Teaching:</span> Providing a solid foundation in biblical knowledge and principles.
<span>Life Skills with Teenagers and Coloring for Younger Ones:</span> Engaging teenagers in discussions on practical life skills while offering creative and age-appropriate coloring activities for the younger children.
<span>Uji Feeding:</span> Ensuring that the children receive a nutritious meal, fostering their physical well-being.
<span>Sports:</span> Promoting physical activity and teamwork through various sports activities.
<span>Visiting Parks:</span> Creating opportunities for outdoor exploration and recreational activities.
<span>Children Visitations/Evangelism:</span> Fostering a sense of community and spreading the message of faith through visitations and evangelistic efforts.

Despite the challenges in space, we are committed to providing a nurturing and engaging environment for our Sunday School Ministry. Our varied activities aim to holistically contribute to the spiritual, intellectual, and physical development of the children in our care.
