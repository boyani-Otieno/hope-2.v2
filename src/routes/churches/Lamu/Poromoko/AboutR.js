      <p>Tumaini Poromoko Church originated as a home fellowship initiated by
         two founding members, Daniel Mwingirwa Nkubitu and his wife Monicah 
         Ann Kioi, the year 2017. The church began with humble beginnings, 
         meeting on Sundays at Daniel Mwingirwa's residence. Over time, the 
         fellowship expanded as more members, including John Kitheka and his 
         family, Margaret Ciamiti, and Laban Musa, joined. In a significant 
         gesture of support, Daniel Mwingirwa and Monicah Kioi generously donated 
         a plot measuring 50 x 100 to establish a permanent church home. In April 
         2022, the construction of the church structure commenced, resulting in the 
         establishment of a semi-permanent facility capable of accommodating up to 50 
         members. At this stage, the church's modest furnishings included benches and 
         two plastic chairs. The collective efforts of the church community played a 
         pivotal role in enhancing the worship space. Through contributions, the church 
         was able to procure essential items such as 20 additional plastic chairs, a 
         plastic table, an all-in-one speaker system, and a pulpit stand. These 
         acquisitions aimed to facilitate a more organized and comfortable environment 
         for the congregation during church services. The journey from a home fellowship 
         to the establishment of a physical church structure reflects the dedication and 
         collaborative spirit of Tumaini Poromoko Church.
