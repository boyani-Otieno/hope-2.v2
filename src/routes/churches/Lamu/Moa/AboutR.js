     <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Established in 2002, Tumaini Church Moa experienced 
        a hiatus before resuming activities in 2014, guided 
        by the leadership of Pastors William, Patrick, and 
        Ondolo, with Pastor Timothy as the primary founder. 
        Presently, the congregation boasts 20 members, consisting 
        of 14 adults along with children and youth. Under this 
        leadership, Tumaini Church Moa remains steadfast in its 
        commitment to fostering spiritual growth and community engagement.
