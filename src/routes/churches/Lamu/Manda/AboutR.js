     <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
         In 2007, Tumaini Manda was inaugurated under the leadership 
         of Evangelist Enos Moyale, Pastor Elis Abour, and Ken Omanya, 
         who served as its founding pastors. Their primary mission was to 
         impart the teachings of the gospel to the local community, 
         initiating a journey of spiritual outreach and engagement. 
         From its inception, Tumaini Manda has been dedicated to spreading 
         the message of hope and faith, contributing to the spiritual growth 
         and well-being of the community it serves.
