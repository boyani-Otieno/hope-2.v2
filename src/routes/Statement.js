      <h4>We believe in the following;</h4>

      <p className='statement'>
        <ul className='one'>

          </li>

          <li>
            The unity of the Godhead with the distinction of person in that
            unity, namely the Father,
            the Son and the Holy Spirit. Co-equal and Co-eternal, to whom equal
            honor is due: Duet. 6:4; Gen. 1:2,26; John 5:17,22,23; John 14:25-26;
            John 16:7,27,28; Phil.2:6; Heb. 1:1,3,7,8

          </li>
          <li>

            <ul className='three'>
              <br></br>
              <li>That the Son of God truly became man being begotten of the
                Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary and His righteousness is
                imputed to all believers
                John 14:3; Rom. 4:22-24; Rom.8:3; Gal. 4:4; Mat 1:20-25; Luke 1:35</li>

              <li>That His death was a sacrifice to God and a propitiation
                for the remission of the sins of His people: Rom. 4:25; 2Cor.5:21;
                Heb.9:24-28; Heb.10:12-14</li>

              <li>That He rose from the dead: Mat. 28:5-7; 1Cor. 15:20-30</li>

              <li>That He ascended to the right hand of God, and is now the
                sufficient High Priest of His 	people Mark. 16:19-20; Luke 24:
                50-51; Acts 1:9; Eph. 4:8-10; Heb.4:14-16; Heb.7:25</li>

              <li>That He will come again to receive His people unto Himself

                Isaiah 9:6-7; Daniel 2:44-45; Daniel 7:13-14.

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            That in consequence of the fall of Adam, man become “lost” and at
            “eternity against God”; 	Psalms 53:2-3;  Luke. 19:10; Romans 3:19; Romans
            5:6:12-19; Romans 8:5-7.
          </li>


          <li>

            <ul className='three'>
              <br></br>
              <li>
                The need of the Holy Spirit’s work in regeneration and sanctification;
                John 3:5-8; John 	16:8-11; Tit 3:4-7; 2Thess. 2:13-14; 1Peter 1:2.
              </li>

              <li>
                Sanctification is a state to be coveted but the doctrines of perfection
                in the flesh is
                contrary to the teaching of the Holy scripture: 2Tim 2:21; 1John 1:8.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>

            <ul className='three'>
              <br></br>
              <li>
                That the justification of the sinner before God is by faith alone: Rom.
                3:21-26; Rom. 4:4-5  Rom 5:1; Gal. 2:16
              </li>

              <li>
                That every Justified is also born of God: John 1:12-13; James 1:18;
                1 Peter 1:23

              </li>
              <li>
                That such new birth should result in and be made evident by holiness
                of life and good
              </li>
            </ul>
            works: Eph 2:10; Eph 4:24; Titus 3:4-8
          </li>
          <li>

            <ul className='three'>
              <br></br>
              <li>
                That at death the Spirit of man does not cease to exist or become
                unconscious: Eccl. 12:7;
                Luke 16:19-31; Luke 23:43; 2Cor 5:6-8

              </li>
              <li>
                That the dead will be raised either to life or to condemnation and
                that the blessedness of
                the righteous and the punishment of the unrighteous will be alike,
                eternal: 1 Cor 15:51-57;
                Phil 3:20-21; Rom 14:9-10; 2;  Cor 5:10; Dan 12:2;  Acts17:31; Rev
                20:11-15
              </li>
            </ul>

          </li>

          <li>
            That Satan is a real personality: he was created  perfect by God and
            given power but through
            pride he fell and became the father of sin, the arch enemy of God and of
            the souls of men: 	Job 1:6-7;
            Ezek 28:14-15  Isaiah 14:12-13 1Peter 5:8
          </li>

          <li>
            The church owns no denominational bonds but regards all believers
            in the Lord Christ as 	members of one
            body of Christ in common with themselves and therefore welcome in the
            fellowship of the holy Spirit all in
            Christ irrespective of race,
            gender, ethnicity, nationality 	provided they sound in the faith and
            seeking to live godly in Christ Jesus.
          </li>

          <li>
            The church meets on the First day of each wee to remember the Lord
            in the breaking of 	bread understanding
            this to be the pattern of corporate worship as revealed in the New
            Testament.
          </li>

          <li>
            The oversight of the church shall be entrusted to the local church
            Council who shall have the
            qualification specified in the scripture.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Summary of our beliefs</h3>

        <p className='summary'>
          We recognize Jesus Christ as God’s living word and sacrifice for sin. It is through God’s initiative in sending Jesus in to the word that receives the knowledge of God in such a way that through faith in Him one comes to the life of the believer to give direction for the living.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
          We recognize that the Bible is God’s written word to man, revealed to and recorded by his apostles and prophets without error and it is our final authority in all matters of faith and practice.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We also believe in the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead  as the guarantee of God’s final victory over sin, evil and death. It is the privilege of those who know Christ to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation. This privilege is never to be occasioned for sin,
          but rather leads to a fruitful, God pleasing life.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          The Church is Christ’s Body on earth is this present age. Every person who has trusted Christ
          is oncorporated in the church.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          We believe that the Lord established two ordinances to be observed intil His return - baptimsand the 
          Lord's Table and we encourage participation
